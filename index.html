        <p><font size="6"><b>Nude Descending Staircase No. 2 (1912)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="6"><b>Marcel Duchamp</b></font></p>

        <p><font size="4">Style: Cubism<br>Media: Oil on Canvas<br>Current Location: Philadelphia Museum of Art</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">An art critic may tell you that this painting is fascinating because it shines a clear light on Duchamp's obsession with motion over figure. However, I find this piece to be at least mildly appealing because of its descending composition.</font></p>
        <p><font size="6"><b>Soir Bleu (1914)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="6"><b>Edward Hopper</b></font></p>

        <p><font size="4">Period: Neoclassicism, American Realism<br>Media: Oil on Canvas<br>Current Location: Whitney Museum of American Art</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Soir Bleu is a very famous American painting, one which displays Hopper's anguish with his career. I find this piece at least slightly amusing due to the composition of light in colour.</font></p>
        <p><font size="6"><b>Glenn (1984)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="6"><b>Jean-Michel Basquiat</b></font></p>

        <p><font size="4">Period: Neo-Expressionism<br>Media: Acrylic, Oilstick and Xerox on Canvas<br>Current Location: Private Collection</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Basquiat is an incredibly controversial artist, many think his following is based on pretentiousness. However, I find his use of art as a personal therapeutical outburst without defined meaning as something that should be more consistent in the art world when given grounded boundaries.</font></p>
        <p><font size="6"><b>The Elephants (1948)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="6"><b>Salvador Dali</b></font></p>

        <p><font size="4">Style: Surrealism<br>Media: Oil on Canvas<br>Location: Private Collection</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">This is an interesting painting. Salvador "God" Dali is known for his complete adoption of the surrealism manifesto as a lifestyle. The obelisks of domination balance on frail legs.</font></p>
        <p><font size="6"><b>La Barricade (1949)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="6"><b>Bernard Buffet</b></font></p>

        <p><font size="4">Style: Miserabilism, Expressionism<br>Genre: Symbolic Art<br>Media: Unknown<br>Current Location: Confidential</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Buffet is amongst the most successful miserabilists and I believe this specific painting highlights the superbity of his composition amongst the expresionists.</font></p>
        <p><font size="6"><b>Self-Portrait with Physalis (1912)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="6"><b>Egon Schiele</b></font></p>

        <p><font size="4">Period: Expressionism, Vienna Secession<br>Media: Unidentified<br>Current Location: Leopold Museum</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Schiele, the prodigal son of Gustav Klimt. This piece is one of the few that reflects his own confidence in himself, the composition is set and defined, the work more realistic than most of his others, each line controlled, and his gaze matching the observer.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"><br>I hope you enjoyed your time viewing this gallery of artworks I find at least mildly appealing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">My apologies to George Rowlett, who only made it to an honorable mention, despite being more proficient than Duchamp.</font></p>
